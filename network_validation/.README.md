<p>Graphs displaying the results of the following network statistics: centrality degree (number of connections a node has), weighted centrality degree, betweenness centrality (number of shortest paths between nodes that pass through a node) and eigenvector centrality (score based on the number of connections a node has, weighted by the score of the connected nodes).</p>
<p>The texts recognised as the most connected ones are: <i>Poemata</i> by Jakob Balde (the darkest and the largest circle), Masen’s <i>Palaestra styli Romani</i> (the second-darkest and the second-largest) and Orlandini’s <i>Historia Societatis Iesu</i> (the third-darkest and the third-largest).</p>
