<p>Here, some additional material about the results of the main experiment are given:</p> 
<ul></ul><li>The file <a href="https://github.com/simon-at-git/stylometric-nl-genres/blob/main/main_experiment/20-1020_Eder's_Delta_MAIN.csv">20-1020_Eder's_Delta_MAIN.csv</a> contains the distance matrix.</li> 
<li>The file <a href="https://github.com/simon-at-git/stylometric-nl-genres/blob/main/stylo_config_main_experiment.txt">stylo_config_main_experiment.txt</a> contains stylo configuration file for the main experiment: bootstrap consensus network run from 20 to 1,020 MFWs, with Eder's Delta, increment of 100, culling @ 10%, consensus strength 50% and no sampling</li>
<li>As the printed version is black-and-white, there are some colour renditions of the graph. The graph with a highlight on all genres (<a href="https://github.com/simon-at-git/stylometric-nl-genres/blob/main/main_experiment/genres-colour.png">genres.png</a>) has colours from <a href="https://github.com/simon-at-git/stylometric-nl-genres/blob/main/main_experiment/palette.png">palette.png</a>. In other graphs, only individual genres or their groups are highlighted and divided by period: ancient-blue, medieval-green, modern-brown. We can see how medieval works tend to gravitate towards the upper and left side of the graph. The isolated nodes in Vulgate reflect the authorship of these texts: they largely represent books from <i>Vetus Latina</i> that were not revised by Jerome (Act, 1 Cor, 2 Cor, 2 Mcc, Rom, Sap).</li>
