<p>Here, some additional material about the results of the main experiment are given.</p> 
<p>The file 20-1020_Eder's_Delta_MAIN.csv contains the distance matrix.</p> 
<p>As the printed version is black-and-white, there are some colour renditions of the graph. The graph with a highlight on all genres (genres.png) has colours from palette.png. In other graphs, only individual genres or their groups are highlighted and divided by period: ancient-blue, medieval-green, modern-brown. We can see how medieval works tend to gravitate towards the upper and left side of the graph.</p>
<p>The isolated nodes in Vulgate reflect the authorship of these texts: they largely represent books from <i></i>Vetus Latina</i> that were not revised by Jerome (Act, 1 Cor, 2 Cor, 2 Mcc, Rom, Sap).</p>
